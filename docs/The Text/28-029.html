<p>-VALENTINES (the next) DAY 2011-<br />
-02:11-</p>
<p>The Monsters have gathered outside of the balcony after Sawyer had finished her transformation. Now that Butters is looking at it this balcony is wild, happily fitting the seven Monsters who found themselves here. Butters couldn't help but wonder why a student flat needed a balcony this ginormous? Perhaps this is why this flat was chosen as the back-up for the house parties since it seems tailored for it. Like the shit bar you go to at the end of the night, except people decide to live there because student accommodation is a never ending sick joke.<br />
Alongside themselves; Chloe, Venus and Quadreco were here tending to a vulnerable Sawyer. They had all gotten them a blanket and she is currently in the process of trying to navigate having a cigarette with her new paws. It's a hell of a thing for Monsters you know? You have all this muscle memory that suddenly becomes a detriment as you have a re-learn a whole new shape. That shape is you! From your footies to your topsies. Butters has had an inconsistent history of paw shapes in their life, perhaps that's why their dexterity with their paws is so good? Otherwise they'd keep having to awkwardly explain why they struggle to hold a cup every few months.<br />
Alongside the familiar Monsters where two Butters hadn't spoken to yet. One looked like a Bengal Tiger, tho not that much bigger then Butters, wearing a beanie and a jersery for an Ice Hockey team coloured black with a few yellow accents. Colchester doesn't have a hockey team as far as Butters knows, so they suspect he might be a student from out of town, or a Colchesterian on their way out perhaps?<br />
The other Monster is sat perched on the railings of the balcony, do you call them railings? Wood Gate Side Bit, whatever, of the balcony having her cigarette. She was wearing a blue shorts and a matching denim short sleeve shirt, that seemed like the "It'll do" temp fix while you find a workers jacket that fits. Butters could tell based on the way the skin on her limbs transitioned into bare talons that this was a Harpy. You can think of the difference between Harpies and just Straight Up Birds is that Harpies have a general template influenced by a kind of bird, as opposed to... Being a bird. It's the bare talons as well as the Beak-esque nose, along side a typical mouth that gives it away. Meanwhile Birds straight up just have a beak that also covers as the mouth and nose. Butters could tell this Harpy is based on a peacock, having the extravagant green feathers coming through her head of hair, as well as covering their wrists and ankles.</p>
<p>After some small talk to each other while Sawyer syncs up back to our reality, the balcony door slides open. Butters turns around to see Rosie sliding the door closed behind her as she rocks up to the group.<br />
―Heeeeeeey. She softly announces in an utterance transparently designed to seek permission to enter the Monsters space.<br />
Butters gives a nod, beckoning Rosie to come over their way. She grins as she puts her hand on Butters waist and the other through their hair, as she kisses The Squirrel again. The other Monsters don't bat an eyelid, or at least don't let it interrupt the flow of the their conversations. With Chloe being the only one who can't tear her side-eyeline away from the pair, as she slowly tenses her jaw and her nails slowly drags across the wooden railing as she clenches her paw.<br />
―Chloe? Are you having a stroke? Asks the Tiger.<br />
―Wha- uhhhh, I mean what makes you say that Gris? Asks Chloe.<br />
―You where in the middle of a reply and just went "uuuuhh, a buuhhh" like you just blue screened. Explains Quadreco.<br />
Chloe puts their face into their paws and just, rubs it all around for a second. That's right Sawyer asked if everyone thought they looked better as a Monster and Chloe's mind just... Trailed off. haha weird. Venus witnessing this from a cross the balcony gives a soft sight with a concerned look, knowing exactly what silently isn't being said.<br />
―Right yeah, sorry before I trailed off. Sawyer I say this with complete sincerity, you are looking like a right snack. Finishes Chloe.<br />
―Oh come oonn. Sawyer replies bashfully. You're all just trying to be nice.<br />
Chloe, now tuned back into reality herself, walks up to the Rabbit.<br />
―No I'm serious! You just... Look right, I dunno. Like someone had factory reset you before and now you're beginning to get back to how you like. Stumbles Chloe through an explanation.<br />
Sawyer twiddles a strand of her now longer hair, not looking like she's convinced. Chloe looks to the other Monsters raising her eyebrows, a.k.a pleading for them to back her up.<br />
―Well, I'm loving your new hair personally. Head hair, not that you're a hare now. I'm not very good at this. Gris clumsily describes.<br />
The Harpy finishes exhaling cigarette smoke and intervenes:<br />
―Look I've known you for about 3 seconds, but you seem like you're happier as a Monster. She observes.<br />
Quadreco puts both sets of hands through their hair before covering their face in visible frustration.<br />
―Look I dunno the delicate way to put this but you're hot now. You were always a smoking hot bitch is what we're getting at. They outburst. I'm not skirting around it, there I said it.</p>
<p>The Moth folds both sets of arms with a slight pouty look. Chloe was worried that might be a little uuuuhhhhhhhhhhh, but notices Sawyer perks up a little bit hearing this. Oh I guess straight up consensual objectifying was the way to go. Chloe clears her throat, as it appears she is in her element.<br />
―Listen stand up straight for me a second sawyer. She asks.<br />
Sawyer comes off from leaning on the balcony side, letting the blanket she was wrapped around fall to the floor. Of course she was still in her outfit from before, a buttoned up shirt and some skinny fit blue jeans, though both very visibly damaged from Sawyers change in species. Specifically Chloe is gesturing her paws at the holes on the thigh area of Sawyer's jeans.<br />
―I mean look at this, hips so wide your jeans have simply become deceased in the process. Chloe explains.<br />
―Yeah and look at this! Quadreco demands, pointing at the bulge at the back of Sawyer's jeans.<br />
―Oh wait, is that... Do I have a tail? Sawyer asks. I mean my tail bone was aching at one point I guess...<br />
―Hang on. Says Chloe, as she tears a hole in the Jeans with her claws, freeing The Rabbits tail trapped inside.<br />
―See look a cute little tail, on a cute little butt. God you're so fucking fit. Quadreco almost snarls between their teeth.<br />
Sawyer covers their face with their paws, but wearing the biggest grin that has probably ever graced her mug. The delict zone between flustered, beaming, embarrassed and horny that all bottoms strive to exist in. Sawyer processes the best she can this elation of receiving desirably that an hour ago she didn't even know she craved.<br />
―I think what these clumsy lesbians are both trying to say... Interrupts Venus. Is that you are absolutely radiant darling. People can see you went from pretending, to being authentic. Whatever that journey looks like from the other side, you're gonna be an amazing Monster, Sawyer.</p>
<p>Sawyer breath starts to audibly quiver, as it seems Venus has gathered everyone's sentiments into a form that resonated with the Rabbit. So now she's flustered, beaming, embarrassed, horny AND crying.<br />
―I mean, are you feeling like this is the real you Sawyer?<br />
The Monsters all turn their heads towards the voice, as it would appear Rosie and Butters have finished fooling around for long enough to join the conversation.<br />
―I dunno, people are telling you this is authentic but, how do YOU feel? Rosie continues.<br />
There's a slight prang of tension as the Monsters on the balcony know how precarious these transformations are, how strong the lure of assimilation can be. But Sawyer gives a happy sigh as she begins her answer.<br />
―I feel like this is me, breathing for the first time. I don't know what the end of this journey will look like, but when you didn't even know you were locking you're own closet I guess breaking the door down has to be a little violent. Explains Sawyer.<br />
―But as long as you're happy? Asks Rosie again.<br />
Butters turns to face Rosie, giving a little disapproving look. But Sawyer isn't deterred.<br />
―Ecstatic. She answers. My feet are planted in a world I never knew I could be a part off. I thought I was just gonna be some dude, invisible and of no note, fucking about on the docks till my grave. Like yeah this is deffo weird. Like my feet cane because I need to re-learn how to even just stand again?<br />
―This is probably the best time to mention, you're gonna wanna say goodbye to those jeans. Interrupts Chloe.<br />
She points to Sawyers feet, which have increased in size dramatically to Rabbit's paws. Paws which now outside the holes of the jeans she was wearing. Chloe, having come to this party in jeans with the bottoms seams torn to be wider is clearly speaking from experience.<br />
―Oh well, I mean that's part of the fun! I get to have a new wardrobe. This new body is an adjustment for sure, but I dunno. I feel like I actually own this one? Where as a Human dude I felt like I didn't own myself, people told me what I was not the other way around. Now I can take back control of this thing. Sawyer explains, as she wraps her arms around her torso and crosses her legs together.<br />
As Rosie goes to speak, Butters grips her shoulder a little harder. She turns to The Squirrel as they shake their head. Rosie catches herself, she knows the fragility she feels does not come from a good place, so she swallows it.</p>
<p>―Oh that's so interesting, you used to be so in tune with your fellow Monsters Butters. A far cry from what happened at the Evermore tonight. Observes the Tapir, still rubbing the wound on top of his head. What changed from then to now I wonder?<br />
―Haha, well you know... a lot of... Things? Replies Butters, confused. Wait, wha? Was a Tapir here on the balcony the whole time? Butters doesn't remember this. [𝓉𝒽𝑒𝓎'𝓇𝑒 𝓃𝑒𝒶𝓇 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝓈𝒽𝑜𝓅𝓅𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒸𝑒𝓃𝓉𝓇𝑒, 𝑜𝓃 𝑀𝒾𝓁𝓉𝑜𝓃 𝓈𝓉𝓇𝑒𝑒𝓉!]<br />
―So have you thought of your new name? Asks The Harpy.<br />
―Ooooohhh, uuhh. Well I havn't really thought about it. I mean I don't hate Sawyer. Can I just be that? A woman named Sawyer? She asks.<br />
―I mean my name is Chord, that's a noun objectively. This one over here is literally called Butters, I don't think a woman named Sawyer will be the weirdest thing a Monster has chosen for themselves.<br />
―Oi! Replies Butters. My name's alright innit?<br />
―Well I like it myself. Replies Rosie as she goes to kiss Butters on the cheek.<br />
Butters looks back at the crowd as if airtight forensic evidence of their Very Cool name had just been submitted. Chord places her talon over her face chuckling.<br />
―So you're deffo one of them transexes? Asks Gris, solidifying his Trying His Best Himbo status to the group.<br />
―I mean I guess? I feel like a woman now I look like this? I'm deffo not a guy now, it'd feel... Painful to go back to that, maybe it always was painful. But woman doesn't feel right either? Sawyer explains.<br />
―Well maybe you're somewhere in-between? I mean that's what I am. Explains Butters.<br />
Rosie looks up at Butters with a sense of intrigue, I guess she never thought to ask that about them until now.<br />
―No no no, like I'm a woman, as in when we all say it. Not as in if Rosie or anyone in there said it. Does that make sense? Sawyer asks. I'm probably talking some shite now, I need to think about it.<br />
―Nah I get it, like I'm hearing what you're stinking. Replies Chloe, confusing her idioms. Like when you guys say I'm a girl that feels fine. If Johnny Dude Cunt called me it, I would tear his eyes out innit?<br />
Sawyer gives a "Right! Oh you so get it" with her face lighting up. Feeling it surreal that she can not only finally vocalise these thoughts, but have them echo back.</p>
<p>―So uh, do you think this is why I changed into a Monster? Cos I'm a trans woman? Sawyer asks.<br />
Everyone hums to themselves a little, that statement doesn't sound right, even if no one in the room can put a finger on why.<br />
―I mean that can't be it, I have trans friends who are Human you see. Explains Quadreco.<br />
―You gotta be a little more spicy then that to trigger it I think. Theorises Chord.<br />
Everyone turns to Sawyer who has her eyes half closed, staring into space. Before realising she's not at her bed yet and rubs her eyes with her paws.<br />
―Well I think I speak for all of us when I say: Time has certainly passed. Announces Venus.<br />
―Shall we start heading off? Asks Chloe.</p>
<p>The Monsters nod in agreement as plans for taxis start being arranged. Rosie grips on Butters' cape as she starts to ask:<br />
―Would you want to go halves on our taxi? Asks Rosie.<br />
Butters looks around the balcony a little confused, surely she must live around here right? But Butters lives the other way, why would they share a taxi if the driver has to turn around. That's going to be a huge fare! Rosie sensing Butters confusion leans in to whisper in their ear:<br />
―Because I was hoping you'd be joining me on my ride home.<br />
Oh. Right. To do the Big Sex. Which would happen at her house. Yes. Okay. Haha. Butters dies a little inside from their own obliviousness. It has indeed: Been a passing of time.</p>
