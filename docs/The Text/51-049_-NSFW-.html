<p>Chloe's laptop stands bellow the small LCD telle attached to the wall, that it's connected too. The screens are basically the same size, but Chloe can never seem to decide which of the two things has a better picture quality so leaves them both on at the same time "Just in case". She has never elaborated on the meaning of this. Both Monsters are laying on Chloe's very single bed side by side, over an hour into their personal watching of The Man Who Is a Gun Who Is a Man.<br />
―It's funny his penis is a shotgun, considering he was just having sex with Woman Face Pussy Girl Face Woman. Comments Butters. That's like fucking when you're about to pass out times twenty.<br />
―It probably has a safety on like a usual gun. Replies Chloe.<br />
Both Monsters look at each other as a smirk slowly crawls up both their faces<br />
―Shame it doesn't come with the one's that arn't guns! They both say in unison.<br />
And they laugh, hahaha. Oh you gotta laugh, to obfuscate the traumatic memories of panic rushing the chemist for plan b first thing in the morning.<br />
―So if his dick's a shotgun, cos they used that sound effect right? Then does that make his foreskin the pump? Asks Butters.<br />
―Get out of my room immediately. Replies Chloe, before giggling to herself.</p>
<p>The two Monsters continued watching the god awful movie, but Butters' mind starts to wander. To fit on Chloe's single bed they've had to both squish together to fit on it. Just feeling their legs rubbing together, or their shoulders bumping into each other is profoundly distracting. After a while it's all they could think about. Before the Squirrel knew it their head was resting on the Cat's shoulder. Being so close to her neck and her chest, she can hear the Cat's breathing, a slight tint of a heartbeat. But more important, every now and then, they get a small feel of a vibration, one Chloe is clearly trying to suppress, but every now and then the slight feeling of purring. Like fucking hell, that's it, wave the white flag, it's over.<br />
Butters reaches over and climbs on top of Chloe without announcement. They lean in close to the Cat's face who's eyes are now twice the size they previously where. They kiss Chloe, not like a passionate lover giving into lust, but like an exhausted spouse coming home to their loved one after a long day. It's soft, loving, familiar. Not adrenaline, but comfort. Not a surprise, but inevitability. As Butters pulls away from Chloe, they sit up straight as they pull their vest over their head. Now Chloe's not trying to imply the current scene of the movie where Gun Man Child Man Gun is currently turning his entire body into a giant flesh gun for Pussy Woman Pussy to shoot the president with isn't peak cinema. But Chloe vastly prefers this view. The volume of her purring now could probably be heard by anyone still downstairs. Butters leans in again to Chloe's face and they whisper:<br />
―I'm sorry, I can't wait anymore, I'm so sorry.<br />
They shuffle down as they unfasten the cord on Chloe's jogging bottoms and starts to pull them off her legs.<br />
―Errrm, uuhh, you're forgiven for your crimes...? But please don't stop committing them on my behalf. Replies Chloe.<br />
She lifts both her knees to her side as Butters shuffles closers, with both of their thumbs tracing the inside of their panties, which happened to have an acorn pattern matching the one that was on their tank top. Chloe barely contains the sweat dripping from their head squeaks out a question.<br />
―So uuhh, do you have the...?<br />
―Chloe, we've know each other for nearly 3 decades right? You know I've never not had them on me for the last 20 years. Answers Butters. And besides I already took it, it's been a bad night and I thought I could depression wank the sad away.<br />
As Butters explains this Chloe now notices them slowly push the bulge in their knickers to the waistline, as they direct their cock into the palm of their paw.<br />
―Well I'm grateful you considered alternatives to your problem. Comments Chloe, grinning ear to ear.<br />
Oooohhh bless the saints there really is a Saint Valentine, Chloe mouths a thank you onto the ceiling as they throw their arms backwards and digs her claws into the back of her bed, as the head of Butters' dick finally passes it's way inside of her. Both Monsters thoughts are in sync about this; it does no good punishing yourself for giving in to what they both want. The consequences and the feelings can come tomorrow, tonight? It's Valentines.</p>
