<p>The 14th stroke of Georgian’s shortest<br />
All I can do is wonder if you’re doing it too?<br />
Recreating snapshots of 8 years hence<br />
In public transit daydreams, during the afternoon’s hue</p>
<p>I must confess I time travel every single time<br />
To the moonlight pouring down the arc of your back<br />
As all communicative functions start to fail me<br />
For all my bravado, I need your help picking up the slack</p>
<p>It’s the perfect antidote to a year in the crosshairs<br />
Suddenly I feel my claws recede into myself<br />
Like I could camouflage into the decor<br />
For just one night, we’re just another pair of lovers<br />
Instead the centrepiece of a wallflower exhibition<br />
Locked into your thighs; finally some peace and quiet<br />
Pacified by temporary humanity<br />
What I would’ve give for the reunion tour</p>
<p>On this day of Saint Valentines~</p>
<hr />
<p>It's funny how the mind remembers the most significant events that have happened to it, even if the person behind it does everything in their power to forget. Recollections of instances that agitate the body's sensations, it'll relentlessly grasp onto them and recall them endlessly, without hesitation.</p>
<p>The scent of the car leather</p>
<p>The chill of the night</p>
<p>The drone of the street lights</p>
<p>Their floorboards creaking as you tiptoe on them</p>
<p>A finger stroking the fur of the back of your hands</p>
<p>Up and down</p>
<p>The sensation that lingers even after the hand has been removed</p>
<p>Catching the alcohol scent on your breath</p>
<p>The blast of sauce on the makeshift pasta the morning after</p>
<p>The chill of the morning</p>
<p>Slowly letting go of your paw</p>
<p>It's that time of year again...</p>
<p>You could go over this forever if could</p>
<p>But the jeering of the 79 robs you of any further time with this compilation.</p>
