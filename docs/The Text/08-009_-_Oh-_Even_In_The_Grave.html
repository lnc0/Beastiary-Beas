<p>Well, here they are after a quick pit stop to stuff their face with cheese bites, they have descended. They had been to the Evermore a few times before, but they couldn't call it a regular on a night out's roster. It's deffo more for the gothic type, monsters and humans alike. You're likely to find both an unholy blashphemous creature born from the embodiment of sin, probably hanging out with a dude in a black hoodie who's music taste never left the 2000's. Not exactly Butters crowd so to speak, but like any pro-monster establishment they're usually kind to anyone who waltzes in. They take a selfie and post it to their profile:</p>
<p>'Start of the Vday night at @The_Evermore. 💕 🐦 💕</p>
<p>Would be an awful shame if someone were to show up on get first dibs on tipsy Butters 😌 🍻'</p>
<p>Much to Butters disappointment they didn’t recognise any of the Monsters in here, no one really got back to them about meeting up either. Well they always knew this was a possibility, it’s time to set out a battle plan. So despite all their ego, there’s no way in hell they can mack on any humans on their own like this. So step one is to befriend one of these monsters, how hard could it be? We’re all in the trash fire that is a human essentialist society, they could find someone to hang with. This was when Butters remembered that even on a platonic level they have the grace and charm of stale bread. Ugh, it’s gonna be tough, come on rum, don’t let them down now! There's gotta be someone they know right?</p>
