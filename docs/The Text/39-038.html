<p>Ben was kicking back his pints like he usually does at the HHA meetings, he felt a sense of dulling of his senses in the sports club bar that he doesn't feel anywhere else, even to his family he is a germ waiting to be expelled. He tried to warn his daughter every time she brought one of THEM round from school, she talks back more and more, his wife looks away when he screams at her to turn off the pronoun cartoons before they brainwash her. But here? This is where he belongs, his duty and his adjacency to the other Huntsman in the bar isn't just a purpose, it's all he is. To be unremarkable in this crowd of middle aged white cis dudes, that's all he is. To spread this to every section of his commute, his job, that's all he is. No desires, no feelings, no reason to live. It's this, he IS this.</p>
<p>―Alright my fellow Huntsman thank you for gatherin' 'ere tonight. Says the branch leader for this sect of the HHA. Now todays mission in operation Deinfestation, we just got word from the local police and have a very simple target for tonight. We need to, remove their threat to Humanist Ideals.<br />
He takes off the cover over the blackboard and behind it... Well Ben was perhaps expecting a little blue hair with pronouns, he did not expect a detailed portrait of himself. He shook his head in disbelief, like what? He turns around for reassurance and see his peer has been replaced with a Tpair Monster<br />
―Yeah! Get the threat of the streets! He cries.<br />
―I've seen this guy shouting how he wants to lock up Monstrous kids! How can I feel good about letting them out with this guy around?<br />
The crowd of now all Monsters, were calling for his murder. Perhaps this would give the Huntsman some perspective about their own horrible actions? ...Yeah you know it didn't, but it did instil a deep fear, that the made-up bullshit she lied his whole life about Monsters doing, maybe one day could manifest.</p>
<p>Two hooves then grasp the back of his head, it was Tyard. The force seems to let the keratin at the end of his fingers penetrate the side of his head. He could feel not on a physical level, but in every essence of the term, that Tyard was entering his very being. His thoughts, perception, processing and his very place on the chronology of this world was now at his mercy. A voice rings out from the fabric of this reality.</p>
<p>―Know as you leave this world, your thoughts are not common, your hatred is unusual and your existence is an affront to Gaia's design. You will leave this world knowing you are truly alone, in every way that matters.</p>
