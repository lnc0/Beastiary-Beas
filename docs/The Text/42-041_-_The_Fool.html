<p>Ell slams her back to the door as she lifts her leg waaay past the 90 degree mark, as she dramatically plummets it back to the earth. Aaaahhhh. Walking. It's not great! Less great? Walking (wet version). Ell shakes her parka around much like a dog with it's fur, in hopes of trying to get some of the rain of her. It doesn't work!<br />
Y'know, Ell thinks 'Rain' but now she thinks about it; rain is typically a 'comes from the up to down' kind of situation. But this stuff was coming from all over the show, tastes a little salty too. Weird! Ell removes their rain boots (rare bit of foresight from the Axolotl) and proceeds to walk into the living room. Except wait no, she realises she is POOPED and feels like she has to preform it somewhat to her non-existent audience. So with a BIG STRETCH and yawn she sits on the stairs, despite her room being mere seconds away. It's only now Ell is noticing how much life there is in the house! Someone has the telly on in the front room, they can hear Chloe hacking her guts out upstairs. Gosh, Ell must've been the last one in! She could even hear some shuffling from the roof.<br />
Oh wait, that means even Butters is in! She thought. Butters. Ooooooohh Butters. Wait Butters is in? Oh no Butters is in!! Did that mean they never found anyone to go out with in the end? Ell's gills dropped a little thinking about them being alone this whole time. Ell knew they didn't do anything wrong by going out tonight, but was still hoping there was some way to make it up to them regardless. This was going to require booting up 'tactful Ell mode', so she entered the living room to see who was in.</p>
<p>She was greeted by the sight of three Monsters sat on the settee watching the big TV in the corner of room. It was Lousid! Along side his theyfriend and their girlfriend; Sebastian (They/Them) and Amber (She/Her).<br />
―Heeeeyyy Big Loose and the other looses!<br />
Lousid who was now just in his red corduroy shirt, completely covering his boxer shorts, slightly turns his head which was resting on his partners belly to give Ell a nod of acknowledgement. Sebastian who was in the centre of the two Monsters, with their right arm around the shoulder of Amber, whilst their left hand was running through the wool of The Sheep's head. They were a Tanuki, wearing brown joggy bottoms with a shirt that was on the Mango Side Of Tanned. On it was little patterns of small leaves all over it, like the one that currently rested on their curly hair. The bottom half of the shirts buttons where open, exposing Sebastians big racoon belly where Lousids head currently lay. The Kitsune at the other end of the settee was wearing a blue asymmetrical shirt with a stripped pattern on one side and a flannel one on the other slightly longer falling side. She was also wearing black lounging jammies, they're all in post-fucking comfy wear is what I'm getting at here. On top of that they were all wearing matching slippers on their feet too (dorks).<br />
Sebastian was the first one to give Ell an actual vocal reply, after giving a bit of sigh towards the Axolotl.<br />
―Welcome back home. But also: What are you even doing here!? Did you not run into trouble on the way back?<br />
Ell tilts her head a little in confusion, honestly when faced with a long walk Ell is typically in their own internal Music Video with their headphones plugged in. So honestly she wasn't paying attention to their surroundings.<br />
Sebastian directs Ell's gaze to the TV which was playing a news report about a huge punch up between Monsters in the town square, ending with footage of a woman perched on top of the Vic Centre directing torrential waves throughout the city.<br />
Ell rubs some of the saltwater of her parka and tastes it again.<br />
―Oh. Well that would explain that! She declares.<br />
―Well we're just glad you're safe. Amber frets.<br />
Ell struts on to the middle of the room, bobbing up and down as she gestures towards the polycule.<br />
―Eeeeeeeee. I'm so happy you all found the time to hang out! Ell celebrates to a slightly embarrassed looking trio. So tteeellllll me what did you get up too.<br />
The three exchanges looks with a slight smirk on their face, waiting for the other ones to make a remark. After a bit of giggling Sebastian speaks up.<br />
―Sinful acts Ell. Too sinful to recount for your innocent Christian ears. They joke.<br />
―The most egregious of acts in the eyes of god: Hand Holding. Jests Amber.<br />
―Weeeell. Ell begins smugly, as she slowly walks on over to the trio. You don't have to be coy with me about... H-A-N-D Holding.<br />
Ell proceeds to finish walking towards Amber's side of the sofa and clasps her hand in the Foxes. There is a small silence as the three try and discern meaning from this. Eventual Amber breaks quiet.<br />
―What exactly is happening here?<br />
―I'm showing you how warm my hand is, from all the H-O-L-D-I-N-G me and Marcidus did<br />
―You're both cold-bloded.<br />
―Well annyywwaayy, Ell continues letting Amber's hand free.</p>
<p>Ell notices Lousid hasn't been speaking much, like what's THAT about? She sees him still resting his head and placing his hand on Sebastian’s belly, with a small look of distress on his face from not being included in the other two’s banter. Huh, being clingy as fuck… BUTTERS!<br />
―Hey did Butters come back with you three? Ell asks<br />
―Uuuhhh no, by the time we emerged from down the basement they had already gone out, come home and went to their room. Answers Sebastian.<br />
―Yeah they’ve not really come out ever since, I hope they’re okay. Amber says to herself.<br />
Lousid gets up from his tummy pillow with a tut.<br />
―Well I wouldn’t waste your worrying on them, they’re probably throwing a massive paddy cos no one wanted to go on their Lonely Hearts Pub Crawl.<br />
―Well what’s wrong with that? If I wasn’t busy with you two goobers I’d love to have gone to that myself!<br />
―Well… Okay but they expected us to drop everything and go gallivanting with them, like heaven forbid we have plans! Or wanna see our theyfriend. Or...</p>
<p>Ell found Lousid's whinging unpleasant, and boring! So she has already left for the kitchen to whip up one of Butters favourites. She gets out a tub of ice cream from the freezer and just grabs a handful and chucks it in the blender. After adding Guts Of A Beetle (strawberry flavouring) into the pot she lets that sucker fly until it's ready. Inelegant, but as the most sober one in this house right now this is likely the best thing on offer. She stares intently at her concoction as she stirs the drink into the consistency she would agree with.<br />
―So how was your night Ell? Amber asks after her from the living room. Did you get up to anything aside from the hand holding?<br />
―Oh yeah I had such a nice night! After hand holding, she did hand holding... My back, as she ran her hands down it for a massage. She explains.<br />
―Mmmmmmm I'm trying to think about getting my back scratched by a blob fish and it feels like it'd be a sensory nightmare for me. Like a cold wet soft... sausage-like.<br />
―Wow, that's a pretty bizarre judgment for someone you've never met honestly. Sebastian ribbed.<br />
―What? Whaat? We're all autistic here, textures are like... Our love language right?<br />
Ell's head tilts slightly again as she stares into space. She can't quite process Ambers statement.<br />
―I dunno what you mean, my back is a sausage? Cos Marcidus like does this thing where she uses the scales on the back of her hand to scritch my back and uhguhghu. Ell moans as she shivers a little. It's the best scritches.<br />
Sebastian and Amber looked a little confused by this, but Lousid gave a little smirk to himself as he had figured it out. When you hear about a Blobfish a gooey gelatinous little guy probably comes to mind. What you typically think of is actually the mutilated corpse of a fish brought into an air pressure so radically different from it's own: It goes goo mode. In reality a Blob fish is just... An unremarkable Fish, So thus: Marcidus was likely just... A Normal fish too. Well as normal as a anthropomorphic fish Monster can be. Just goes to show Monsters can be clumsy about assuming the experiences of each other, even the most tuned in Monsters still perceive each other through a Human perspective. They say gooey corpse is a blob fish and also literally call it a blob fish? Well if you don't know any better!<br />
At this point Ell's attention had already waned, with finished milkshake in hand she started to head upstairs to see if Butters was okay! Butters shotgunned the attic when they all moved in, so going to see them counts as your daily exercise. So Ell starts the trek to their room, she hops up each step humming a tune in her heart until she approaches their door.</p>
