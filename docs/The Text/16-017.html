<p>Hahahaha it's been 20 minutes, oh god they all hated Butters this whole time and they ARE going to die alone. Maybe even tonight!<br />
Hahaha their mind starts to unhinge, kind of like when your jaw does when you feel like you're gonna chunder? The chunder of the mind as it were. After all this time they've learnt to spot the first feelings of this way in advance. Butters starts to slightly rock back and forth on their bar stool, with a slight hint of rhythm to regulate their breathing (it's not enough to just imagine the feather as it were). Okay. Okkaaayy. Like let's think about it, there's loads of things that could've happened like, hey: Either of the groups could've bumped into some mates, that's fine! What do you want them to spend all of their time coin on you? No! That's silly. They'd never be secretly hoping that every second of every day for everyone they know. Like no way!<br />
Butters collects themselves, takes a deep a breath. They recall that if they were a well adjusted person they might consider feeling hhmmmm, maybe worry? A little concern? Instead of immediately internalising what could be their something horrible happening to their new companions. Okay let's give that a go... Oh no!!! Butters downs their pint and has the foresight to ask the barkeep if any Witches, Derby Skaters or Horse Woman With Human Feet come back here, to let them know "Butters is looking for them." They then wipe their foam beard unceremoniously on their sleeve and start to wander around the Evermore.</p>
<p>But only a few steps towards the back exit, the one which goes to Pelham and some commotion completely steals their attention. Butters notices a little gathering of people, Monsters and Humans alike, near the doors trying to get a nosy at what's going on (but heaven forbid they're close enough to justify engaging in any way). With every step it's obviously there's a punch up going on outside, as they approach the exit the contents of the shouting becomes more clearer. Butters feels a drop in their stomach as they begin to recognise the recipient of the voice. It was Gor:<br />
―Ya' reckon you can jus' bottle one of us an not expect ta' get your ass beaten aye? Ya' musky cunt!<br />
Butters scans the exit to see just off to the right, some Monsters and the bar staff were tending to a gash on a Tapiar's head. A Baku they reckoned, based on their night sky patterned Haori and whiff of arcane they were exuberating, Butters heart ached as they looks genuinely shook up.<br />
―I-I-I dunno what I d-did wrong, it was just a, uh a little pub bet, little game thing and he just lobbed his pint glass at me when he lost. Is there some Human etiquette I did wrong? Is it my fault? The Tapiar Stammered.<br />
Butters teeth grit, they flex their paws in a claw shape, for a little moment that want to stay palatable to humanity erodes away completely. They swing the exit doors open, fully intending to return this Humans 'Kindness' back with interest. Outside they witness the scene, Ideas trying to hold Gor back with some tactical positioning of their bottom half as Gor screams at the humans responsible. They look over and it's another familiar face. It was Chelsea's two friends from the bar earlier: Simon and the peanut pinging guy, Andre.</p>
<p>Aaaannnnddd the need to placate is back.</p>
<p>No no no no no noooo, the night was going so well, no no no why? Why!? What the fuck did they do?!?<br />
―Yeah, I'll bottle anyone who cheats me out of a bet! No way that baked bean toe'd pig beat me at peanut pong! Shouted Andre<br />
―Oh interesting! Cos you lost to plenty of Humans I notice and you didn't let them leave with a cut on their brow? Interjected Ideas'<br />
―Humans arn't filthy cheaters, I supposed that's natural to your type right? Jealous you look like fuckin' freaks and not normal like us so you have to take it out with your shitty magic. Retorts Simon<br />
―Oh trust, if'e wanted ta' look like I 'ad just had me mug ran over by a car, I'd just lay in the road 'n wait. Ain't hard mate. Replies Gor.<br />
―You talk shit, but it doesn't change the fact you got this normal feet horse bitch over here. I mean look at it, the only way you can justify not blowing your own brains out is to make us the bad guys. That's what it is isn't it? You just wanna kill all us humans cos we're actually normal and you can spread all your degeneracy to all the kids I bet! Y'know I'd be doing the world a favour if I just nutt you now. Rants Andre.<br />
The more the spoke the more The Humans stopped even resembling living things with a tangible molecular make up, like their very flesh was looking more loose. Andre even had some kind of... something dribbling from their mouth. They were just living ideology and hate, barely held together.<br />
―Butters! Just in time, help us out with these fuckin' louts will ya? Asked Gor.<br />
The pendulum swings again, yeah Butters was ready to lay these 'Sapians out. Butters was an idiot to think any Human walked this earth for any other reason then to eradicate every Monster, any divergent form of life, off this planet.</p>
<p>Just as Butters took their first step towards the scene, that's when Butters crosses into the eyeline of Chelsea, who was standing by her friends the entire time. The image of her almost wouldn't process correctly in Butters' mind. Like no come on, she was just being so sweet not even half an hour ago! Like you don't just be that nice to a Monster if you thought this about us... There's no way, like come on. Any minute now she'll tell these lads to pack it in. Come. ON.<br />
But all that follows is a look, not of sadness or of stress, but a command. "You wouldn't turn on me" the sheer confidence in it. It's starting to dawn on Butters, she's not going to stop them. In fact she's wanting Butters to join them. That's the look "They're being unreasonable, you know what your type are like, unruly! Tell them to stop." Yeah that's the look.<br />
The fight leaves Butters body completely, the confidence in Chelsea's eyes is not unearned. Knowing those eyes will be fixed on them the entire time, it just disables Butters completely. Pathetic. A human they've known for a hour says don't stop a genocide attempt and you'd do it. Of course you would. Hey they're not saying Die For Them so Butters should be grateful for the compromise! Pathetic. Butters can't take it, they hate this, they hate Humans, they hate themselves, they hate that Monsters always make a scene, they hate that they just referred to Monsters standing up for themselves as a 'scene'. They really hate themselves. Butters can feel the tears building up in their eyes.</p>
<p>They can't do this. They run. They bolt it inbetween the two sides and headed straight towards the wall of the pub on the opposite side of Evermore. Butters then runs up the wall about half of the way and ricochets off the wall with such force it leaves a crater in the wall and shattering the windows. All to land on and do the same off the wall that would let them gain as much momentum to get the hell out of there and up Thurland Road as fast as humanly possible.<br />
―Whoa whoa, Butters where are you going!? Ideas yells after Butters.<br />
They allotted no cognitive thought onto to WHERE they were going, they just had to get somewhere else. Not here. Not tonight. After a while they found themselves somewhere outside of a nearby alley. They were speeding for a minute or two, like this had to be Hockley way or something right? The Squirrel immediately starts to pace back and forth, kicking the ground, pinging between absolutely frustration and hysterical despair. They really really hate themselves. So disappointed, so disappointed that they ran away. So angry they had to run away. Mad that they cannot handle their emotions. Ashamed they let Humans convince them to abandon their siblings. Frustrated their hormones havn't calmed down from before. They want to cry, die, eat something and fuck at varying degrees all at the same time right now.</p>
<p>They spot a Not Immediately Horrible Human skulking by, staring at this display. Butters jeers back at them<br />
―If you got time to stare, you got time to bend me over in this alley. They suggest.<br />
Now... If Humans were creatures capable of any empathy maybe it might cross their mind not to take the crying Monster up on that offer, but nothing beats in their cold decrepit chest. What follows is a truly miserable five minutes, from a man who cannot comprehend the X axis of movement can also mean swaying side-to-side, alongside thrusting foward-and-back. After he dry coughs some cum out, he gives a 'cheers' and throws the johnny on the floor next to Butters. Thank christ he even gave the courtesy of a condom, though likely not out of any charity, more likely he heard about Monsters having 'Mega-nits' or something.<br />
Butters pulls their shorts back up, puts their back to the wall in the alley and just... Slumps back to the floor. Like... What the fuck? What the fuck man... How did it just... Get this bad? Like everything? The act of still continuing to be. It's all just bad. Butters can't help but grab their tried and true backlog of memories to go dive back into. Back to when things where at the very least bareable. When surviving was still an attractive prospect to them. When Valentines Day absolutely ripped. They have a favourite of course, in fact their favourite is their first good one, the one they still think over every time this day comes around. It all started back in college, when they got that invite to the uni party...</p>
