<p>-VALENTINES DAY 2017-<br />
-15:46-</p>
<p>Butters almost lift off the ground with how much the atmosphere lightens on the outside. The skies, buildings, people, possibly the atoms themselves are all grey but The Squirrel feels great taking in that first breath in of fresh air. With a spring in their step Butters starts turning up the volume on their music player to drown out any pesky reality around them that could harsh this high, before they momentarily return to the mortal realm to check on the group chat:</p>

<p>Butters had been trying to rally up excitement from their roommates all day, trying to inject some of their own enthusiasm into their companions. For you see it was Valentine’s Day, a trite ritual of performing traditional romance via tacky last minute gifts from the petrol stop on the drive home for most, but for Butters however they had a mission; to bring Valentine’s back to its roots. Couples? Relationships? Nawwwwh fam, this was a day for the depraved deviants! Confessions? Dates? Parties? You can have them all on Saint Valentine’s Birthday! They're gonna get their thussy rrrooooccckkkkeeedddd~ &lt;3</p>
<p>Valentine's has been particularly kind to Butters in the past, some of their wildest nights have been on Valentine’s. After a year-long stint of being meek, feeling ugly as shit, both as a Monster and in general, today is to be the one day they can feel on par with the rest of the world. No backhanded “for a Monster” compliments during small talk, or feeling like they’re clawing their way uphill just to speak to anyone for longer than three minutes. This is the night, everyone’s guard is down, and they can feel like ‘Butters’, not just another Monster for one night…</p>
<p>However, despite their noble aim, Butters has been lax on spreading the word of Saint Valentine. But not this year bbaayybbeee, this time Butters is flying solo and it's time to reclaim Valentine’s from the clutches of capitalist, bioessentialist forces! The only thing missing is literally anyone else to go with. They had a right job even getting their housemates to even agree to the possibility of coming out with them, let alone making them follow through.</p>
