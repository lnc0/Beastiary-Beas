There was time, so much time, between when Butters walked in thriough the front door and now. They were happy as larry when they first walked in through that door, satisfied with ending the evening with new friends and reunion with an old one. But there was so much time, time to spot Lousid, Seb and Amber in the front room, time to go to their room and for the scilence to become madening, time to flick through social media and see all the couples and hookups plastered all over their feed. That blossoming solidarity with Monsters came crashing down. You see this is what Humanity offers in exchange for obediance and assimilation. This fending of the lonliness and isolation, people would SURELY love you if you wern't so weird and hung out with bad company, comapny which would never love you, not like we would. We would've come home with you tonight, absolutely! But you made your choice didn't you Butters?

And that is single handedly how the allure of Humanity makes it's way back into Butters mind.

======================================

But the sheer paranoia of it slowly crept into Butters, their body language started to become more and more closed. They put out their cigerette and kept their gaze unwaivering to the path in front of them. Think of it of diagnol arc of half looking at the floor and half looking up, making full use of periferal vision, but still keeping the visual noise to a minimum. This also avoids meeting anyones gaze, which Butters learned growing up in Essex very fucking quickly, is the equivelent of sending a missive to someone giving them full permission to confront you in any which way they like. This gaze as it all, keeps you locked into your enviroment, able to notice any little change or shift, all while appearing as non-threatening and uninviting as possible.
But man the openness. They feel every by stander's gaze literly take the breath out of their body. It was taking so much energy for Butters to not give into a panic attack and regulate their breathing, it'd compramise their ability to react to whoever in their vicinity would decide a Monster being outside without their permission was a crime too far. They could come at them from anywhere, a full 360 of vantage. Butters could feel this vaccum slide down their back, there shouldn't be this much distance between their back and the nearest surface. Their breathing quivers a little to hold back bursting into tears, the compulsion, like a cat exposing it's belly, maybe if Butters looked as weak as possible they could just waltz on here without drama? But their logcial brain wins out, they can't surrender this alertness, no way.

It can't of been more then a minute, but Butters body felt heavy and every footstep a perfectly calcuated and execuated acceleration. Tyard could notice how much Butters was tensing up and one cold breeze away from breaking down completely, but had no idea what he could say. It shouldn't matter anyhow, they only have the other half of the walkway to go and then it'd be their friends problem. Oh if only it was so easy, as a small symphony of steps grew louder and louder originating from where the two Monsters had come from. Butters turns around immeditly, standing up stright to face whatever it was heading their way.
